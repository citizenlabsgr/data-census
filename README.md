This project updates the City of Grand Rapids' entry in the US City Open Data Census. The Open Data Census is a crowdsourced measure of public access to public datasets in municipalities across the United States. The project is run collaboratively by the [Sunlight Foundation](http://sunlightfoundation.com/) and [Open Knowledge International,](http://okfn.org/) with the help of a dedicated group of volunteers.

* Data Census for the years [2013 - 2016](http://us-city.census.okfn.org)
* Data Census for the years [2018 - current](http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org)

The U.S. City Open Data Census is a benchmarking tool that gives city staff and residents an understanding of what datasets are available in their city, and how their city compares to others across the country when it comes to open government data.
