# Contributing to the US City Data Census:

### Step 1: Get Smart Quick

You may have already done some of this, if not do the following:

- Read the [ReadME.](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/data-census/blob/master/README.md)
- View the [US City Data Census website.](http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org)
- Read About [US City Data Census.](http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org/about/). Pay special attention to the datasets and descriptions provided.
- [Read the FAQ](http://us-cities.survey.okfn.org/faq/).

### Step 2: Check On The Status of Updates - Begin Contributing

Go to our project status to check on the [status of specific updates](https://github.com/citizenlabsgr/data-census/projects/1) to the Census. Then begin work on one of the open issues.

We will be looking for the datasets:

- Budget: The planned budget by unit of appropriation with a programmatic description of each unit of appropriation.
- Business Listings: A directory of all licensed businesses in the municipal area.
- Code Violations: Building code inspection data surfacing reports on particular properties from code enforcement officials.
- Construction Permits: Locations of issued construction permits.
- Crime Reports: The date, time, location, incident type of any crimes reported as well as narrative information, if available.
- Emergency Calls: Calls for service from Police, Fire, and EMS.
- Employee Salaries: Annual salary information including base pay and overtime pay for all active, permanent employees of the city.
- Lobbyist Activity: Lobbyist registration and activity.
- Parcels: Data on the geographic boundaries of properties.
- Police Use-of-Force: Listings of incidents where police used force to compel compliance.
- Procurement Contracts: The full text of municipal contracts with vendors, including the amount, awardee (name, address), and date awarded.
- Property Assessment: Data about assessed property values.
- Property Transfers: Records of property sales, mortgages, and foreclosures.
- Public Facilities: Locations of buildings owned by the city government.
- Restaurant Inspections: Outcomes of food safety inspections of restaurants and other similar providers of food to the public.
- Service Requests: Non-emergency service requests for things like graffiti, broken traffic lights, noise complaints, parking law enforcement, and potholes.
- Spending: A complete list of city expenditures at a detailed transactional level (including tax breaks, loans, contracts, grants, and operational spending).
- Traffic Crashes: Data on all motor-vehicle-related crashes.
- Website Analytics: Data about web traffic to the city government website.
- Zoning: The mapped zone (GIS) shapefiles of designated permitted land use.

### Step 3: Submit your city's information

Anyone may submit information about the availability (or lack thereof) of designated datasets in your city at any time. To begin, click the "+ Add" button in any field on the home page. Fill out the subsequent information as completely as possible, and double-check to make sure your answers are accurate.

Once you have submitted your information, your submission will become an official entry in the Census and displayed in the main table of the website.

If you want to make a new submission for a place and dataset where there's already an existing entry (like if you want to correct or update the existing entry), there are several ways to do that. If you're on the home page, click on that entry then click "Update." If you're on that place's page, find the row with the dataset in question, and click the pencil icon on the right edge of that row. Either way, you will be taken to a page where you can make a new submission.

### Step 4: How to add a new place

If you don't see your city on the list, a site administrator can help add it. Email the administration team at usopendatacensus@gmail.com (run by staff at the Sunlight Foundation) and we will add your city to the site.
